    <p>Your garden website is designed with the serious gardener in mind.</p>
    <p> Few things are as annoying as searching through old seed catalogues and
    piles of old scraps of paper trying to figure out what variety of tomato you
    planted last year or the year before. Your Garden Planner solves those problems by
    centralizing all of that information and storing it for you. 
    Here you'll find an easy way to track all of the plants you have in your gerden,
    automatic tracking of all the plants you've had in the past.</p>
    <p>Coupled with this, we have a clean, ad free interface, making using the website
    easy and intuitive.</p>
